What are the quality control lists?

In order to help you to examine the quality of an annotation, YGAP generates several of lists of genes in particular categories including:

Ancestral genes with no ortholog in your genome: This is a list of the genes present in the â€˜Ancestralâ€™ yeast genome (see Gordon et al, PLOS Genetics 5:e1000485, 2009) that do not have any ortholog annotated in your genome. For a good genome sequence and annotation, this list should be fairly short and the listed pillars may require manual checking. Note that for a post-WGD genome, this check only requires the species to have 1 gene in the pillar.

Genes annotated only because they contain a large ORF: One of the final steps in the YGAP pipeline is to search for any large ORFs (> 150 amino acids) that do not overlap with other genes and were not otherwise annotated as genes. This output is a list of the genes annotated by this step. They are not assigned to any pillar in the mini-YGOB browser. This list may include artifacts such as fragments of genes that contain uncorrected frameshift errors, or pseudogenes, or highly divergent genes that should actually have been placed in a YGOB pillar.

Genes that may be very divergent from their orthologs: This is a list of genes that were detected only by SearchDOGS (OhEigeartaigh et al, BMC Genomics 12:377, 2011). SearchDOGS uses synteny and similarity to detect genes and is particularly effective for annotating small and highly divergent genes.

Genes in your genome that are singleton pillars in YGOB: This is a list of genes that are in singleton pillars in YGOB. These genes are not necessarily 'unique' as they can correspond to gene duplicates for which no homolog exists in a syntenic position in any of the YGOB species. However, this list should also contain members of any species-specific gene families, or genes that were gained by horizontal gene transfer.
