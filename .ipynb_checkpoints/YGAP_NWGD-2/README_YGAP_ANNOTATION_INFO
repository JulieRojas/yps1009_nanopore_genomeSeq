What are the columns in the annotation file?
The columns are:
Column 1: Gene name.
Column 2: Strand.
Column 3: Lowest coordinate of the gene.
Column 4: Highest coordinate of the gene.
Column 5: YGOB browser status (all ON).
Column 6: Chromosome (scaffold) number.
Column 7: Gene short name.
Column 8: Gene coordinates (including introns).
Column 9: Name of orthologous Ancestral gene (if present).
Column 10: Name of homologous S. cerevisiae gene.
Column 11: Gene type.
Column 12: YGOB pillar number.
Column 13: Annotation tag (Cor / Fra / Man / NNN) â€“ see below.
Column 14: Annotation route (simple / multi / GETORF / DOGS) â€“ see below.

Annotation tags:
Cor means that the gene underwent successful automatic frameshift correction, resulting in a translatable sequence.
Fra means that the gene contains a probable uncorrected frameshift error. This could either be because YGAP was unable to correct the error, or because you did not select the frameshift correction option.
Man™ means that the gene has been flagged for manual attention. These are either untranslatable, or they are suspicious because of their length or because they overlap other genes.
NNN means that the coding region of the gene begins or ends in a run of NNN nucleotides (i.e. in a gap between two contigs in a scaffold).

Annotation routes:
Simple means that the gene was easily assigned to a YGOB pillar by YGAP.
Multi means that the gene is a member of a multigene family and its pillar assignment may be unreliable.
GETORF means that the gene was annotated only because it contains a large ORF.
DOGS means that the gene was annotated by the SearchDOGS step.
